# PacMen Exercise üïπÔ∏è


## Description

In this project, there are two button options, **Add PacMan** and **Start Game**.  Every click of the **Add PacMan** button will add a PacMan character to the window.  Clicking the **Start Game** button will start moving the PacMan characters that were previously added.  When the characters hit the edge of the window on the x-axis, they will change the direction they are moving and face the opposite direction.
